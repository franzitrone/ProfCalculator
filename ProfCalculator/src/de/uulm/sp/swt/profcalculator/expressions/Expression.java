     * Recursively computes and returns a string representation of the expression.

     * In case every expression e is decorated as new NecessaryBrackets(e) before
     * inserted into the parent expression, brackets will be added were necessary.
     * As both, addition and multiplication are associative, brackets are not needed
     * in most situations. The only case where brackets are needed is if an addition
     * is the left or right child of a multiplication, as multiplication binds
     * stronger than addition.
     *
     * Example: (1 + 2) * 3 = 9 whereas 1 + 2 * 3 = 1 + (2 * 3) = 7
     *
     * As new Multiplication(new Addition(a,b),c).evaluate() !=
     *    new Addition(a,new Multiplication(b,c).evaluate()
     * we use brackets to indicate if the addition is supposed to bind stronger in a
     * particular case.
